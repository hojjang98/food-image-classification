# 🍽️ Food Image Classification

> *"I heard computer vision is trending these days..."*

This project started with that simple thought.  
While studying machine learning, I learned from my professor that the field of computer vision (CV) is rapidly gaining momentum and practical importance.  
Curious and excited, I decided to jump into it and explore image classification through this beginner-friendly project.

## 🎯 Project Goal

- Build a food image classifier using CNN and transfer learning.
- Gain hands-on experience with core CV tasks: preprocessing, augmentation, and evaluation.
- Understand the fundamentals of image classification in a practical, applied context.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: [Fruits and Vegetables Image Recognition DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/fruit-and-vegetable-image-recognition)
- **Size**: 101 food categories, 101,000 images  
  *(Note: I will use a smaller subset for faster experimentation.)*

## 🔧 Techniques Used

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Transfer Learning (ResNet, EfficientNet)
- Image Augmentation (`ImageDataGenerator`)
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Visual Predictions
